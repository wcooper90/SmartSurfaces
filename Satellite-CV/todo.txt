- keep playing with contrast, saturation, sharpness, to find best combination for
    polygon approximation
- play right rectangles, save rectangles in another folder, run through
    testAlgos for close ups of roofs, then create slope functions
- standardize the image inputs, write functions to calculate roof areas
- be able to find albedo of an image
