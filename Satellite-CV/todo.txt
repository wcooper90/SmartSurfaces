 - be able to calculate albedo of an image
 - randomly select multiple areas within city boundaries for
    Google Earth API to be able to return images for
 - in outputs, create file which makes a pandas dataframe/excel file which
    consists of cities, along with their final statistics, with confidence
    intervals
 - continue tweaking opencv to be able to detect roofs (color & shape)
 - documentation
 - figure out Google Earth API
 - create the formal Image class

 4. use polygon approximation to filter out roads/bodies of water/etc.
 5. draw contours over original image
