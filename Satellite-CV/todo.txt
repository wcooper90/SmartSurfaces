- take green out of test algorithms, run through testAlgo repo to calculate surface area of roofs.
- calculate surface area covered by random sample of images
- make sure random sample of images don't overlap
- how much area of a city do we need to cover in order to fully esimate?
- shapefiles for cities, to determine if the random generated points are actually in the city?
- convert roof footage to mileage
- separate trees from grass with iTree canopy?
- calculate average albedo over the images
- input albedo, roofage, and tree canopy into the dataframe
- try zooming in or out to better roof detection, sharpening image?
