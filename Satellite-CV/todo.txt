- make sure random sample of images don't overlap
- make sure roofs don't overlap too much
- shapefiles for cities, to determine if the random generated points are actually in the city?
- separate trees from grass with iTree canopy?
- calculate average albedo over the images
- input albedo, roofage, and tree canopy into the dataframe
- try zooming in or out to better roof detection, sharpening image?
- otsu's binarization on altered images
