- make sure random sample of images don't overlap
- make sure roofs don't overlap too much
- shapefiles for cities, to determine if the random generated points are actually in the city?
- fix functions which find another raw image if the first one is all green
- change tree detection algorithm - sharpen, save as transparent? canny edge detection?
  - normalize the set of images (brightness and contrast)
  - polygon approximation and rectangles
  - calculate entropy, contrast, and brightness of trees
  - create series of conditional statements
  - align for Stockton, then test on other cities
- do a run on Baltimore
- make calibrate() function, to adjust images depending on location in the U.S.
